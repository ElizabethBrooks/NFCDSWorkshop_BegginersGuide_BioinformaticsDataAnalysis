Given the increasing amount of data being generated today, programmatic data analysis is an important skill for a wide range of fields. The R programming language and Unix/Linux command line can be powerful tools for analyzing data on their own. More powerfully, the huge variety of R and command line tools can be used together with scripting to create custom pipelines to analyze large or complex data sets.

## Audience
The first part of the workshop is designed for anyone interested in learning more about programming best practices, and how to create R and BASH scripts to automate data analysis. No prior programming or data analysis experience is required.

The second part of the workshop is designed for anyone interested in learning how to combine R and BASH scripting to automate the analysis of biological data sets. For example, biologists interested in learning how to create pipelines that use a combination of R scripts to analyze and visualize data. Another potential application of the skills learned from this workshop is the ability to create a set of scripts that work together to integrate specific omics tools in a data analysis workflow.
